**React Native UI Challenge**

## 🎯 **Objective**
The goal was to recreate one of the provided UI designs using React Native, focusing on:

* Layout structure
* Typography
* Color accuracy
* Responsive design
* Reusable components
* Clean and maintainable code

The task tested my ability to translate a static UI design into an interactive and responsive screen using React Native best practices.

## 🔧 **Features & Implementation**

### ✔️ Accurate UI Replication

* Matched layout, spacing, and alignment based on the chosen design.
* Used similar fonts, colors, and icon styles.
* Ensured all elements from the design were included.

### ✔️ Reusable Components

I created custom components such as:

* `Button`
* `Card`
* `Header`
* `InputField`
  (Adjust based on what you actually built.)

These components are reused throughout the screen to keep the code clean and maintainable.

### ✔️ Responsive Design

* Used Flexbox for layout.
* Applied `%`, `flex`, and `Dimensions` to support different screen sizes.
* Tested responsiveness on multiple device sizes.

### ✔️ Interactivity

* Buttons have hover feedback (if tested on web).
* Elements respond visually when pressed.
